1.2 Description 
Linear Regression:
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning model that 
attempts to model a linear relationship between dependent variables 
(Y) and independent variables (X). Every evaluated observation 
with a model, the target (Y)’s actual value is compared to the target 
(Y)’s predicted value, and the major differences in these values are 
called residuals. The Linear Regression model aims to minimize the 
sum of all squared residuals. Here is the mathematical representation 
of the linear regression:
Y= a0+a1X+ ε
The values of X and Y variables are training datasets for the model 
representation of linear regression. When a user implements a linear 
regression, algorithms start to find the best fit line using a0 and a1. 
In such a way, it becomes more accurate to actual data points; since 
we recognize the value of a0 and a1, we can use a model for 
predicting the response.
• People looking to buy a new home tend to be more conservative 
with their budgets and market strategies. 
• This project aims to analyse various parameters like average 
income, average area etc. and predict the house price accordingly.

• This application will help customers to invest in an estate without 
approaching an agent 
• To provide a better and fast way of performing operations. 
• To provide proper house price to the customers. 
• To eliminate need of real estate agent to gain information 
regarding house prices. 
• To provide best price to user without getting cheated. 
• To enable user to search home as per the budget. 
• The aim is to predict the efficient house pricing for real estate 
customers with respect to their budgets and priorities. By analyzing 
previous market trends and price ranges, and also upcoming 
developments future prices will be predicted. 
• House prices increase every year, so there is a need for a system to 
predict house prices in the future. 
• House price prediction can help the developer determine the 
selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the 
right time to purchase a house.
• We use linear regression algorithm in machine learning for 
predicting the house price trends
